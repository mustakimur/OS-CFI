# Origin-sensitive Control Flow Integrity
We propose a new context for CFI, origin sensitivity, that can effectively break down large ECs and reduce the average and largest EC size. Origin-sensitive CFI (OS-CFI) takes the origin of the code pointer called by an ICT as the context and constrains the targets of the ICT with this context. It supports both C-style indirect calls and C++ virtual calls. Additionally, we leverage common hardware features in the commodity Intel processors (MPX and TSX) to improve both security and performance of OS-CFI. Our evaluation shows that OS-CFI can substantially reduce the largest and average EC sizes (by 98% in some cases) and has strong performance â€“ 7.6% overhead on average for all C/C++ benchmarks of SPEC CPU2006 and NGINX.

*Note: Intel MPX is deprecated in latest CPU and kernel, so some part of code will require to adjust for latest.*

## IMPORTANT

This is a research prototype. Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that the original concept works. It is expected to have implementation flaws or can be broken/deprecated to latest sysyem. We welcome efforts to re-produce/evaluate our results but request an opportunity to fix any technical flaws. Generally speaking, we value design flaws more but will try to fix technical issues too.

**If you plan to use this project in production, we would love to hear about it and provide help if needed (Join our slack channel).**

## Project Structure
- **llvm-src:** LLVM/Clang 7.0 Source Directory.
    - **clang/lib/CodeGen:** Fake reference monitor and metadata update Instrumentation.
    - **llvm/lib/Transforms/instCFG:** CFG, optimization, and original reference monitor instrumentation.
- **oscfi-lib-src:** OSCFI reference monitor and metadata source code.
- **svf-src:** Modified DDA to generate CFG and tag locations (for label-as-value).
- **pyScript:** Python code works on DDA generated CFG to reconstruct the original CFG.
- **testSuite:** Stores sample cases to test the project.
- **run.sh:** Bash script to run the OSCFI on any targeted project.

## Overall Process
- Step 1: Copy OSCFI monitor codes.
- Step 2: Build the target project with OSCFI clang/clang++.
- Step 3: Run SVF-SUPA (DDA) from OSCFI to generate the CFG. It also creates labels for translation (also known as  label-as-value).
- Step 4: Build the binary. Later, dump the section 'cfg_label_tracker' from the binary. Finally, run a python script to reconstruct the CFG.
- Step 5: Instrument the CFG using a LLVM pass.
- Step 6: Repeat step 4 and 5 to reconstruct the CFG due to optimization effect.
- Step 7: Build the final binary (secured by OSCFI).


## Installation Guideline
The following guideline assumes a fresh [ubuntu:21.04](https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core/blob/4b7cb6f04bc4054f9ab1fa42b549caa1a41b7c92/hirsute/Dockerfile) docker container has been used. We recommend to use the docker installation guideline (check above).

Following commands are for preparing basic tools:
```
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install git cmake g++ python python3-pip wget
```

Following commands are for preparing radare2 (a binary diassembler):
```
wget https://radare.mikelloc.com/get/4.5.0-git/radare2\_4.5.0-git\_amd64.deb
dpkg -i radare2\_4.5.0-git\_amd64.deb
pip install r2pipe
rm radare2\_4.5.0-git\_amd64.debrm radare2\_4.5.0-git\_amd64.deb
```

Following commands are for configuring the build:
```
git clone https://github.com/mustakimur/OS-CFI.git
echo "export OSCFI_PATH=\\"/home/OS-CFI\\"" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

Following commands are for preparing Gold plugin build:
```
apt-get install linux-headers-5.11.0-17-generic csh gawk automake libtool bison flex libncurses5-dev
apt-get install apt-file texinfo texi2html
apt-file update
apt-file search makeinfo
```

Following commands are for building binutils required for Gold plugin:
```
cd /home
git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils
mkdir binutils-build
cd ../binutils-build
../binutils/configure --disable-gdb --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werrorcd ../binutils-build/
make
```

Following commands are for building compiler with Gold plugin:
```
cd $OSCFI_PATH/
mkdir llvm-obj
cd llvm-obj/
cmake -DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR="/home/binutils/include" -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm-src
make -j8
```

Following commands are for replacing existing binaries with Gold plugin binaries:
```
cd /home
mkdir backup
cd /usr/bin/

cp ar /home/backup/
cp nm /home/backup/
cp ld /home/backup/
cp ranlib /home/backup/

cp /home/binutils-build/binutils/ar ./

cp $OSCFI_PATH/llvm-obj/lib/libLTO.* ./
```

Following commands are for building SVF-SUPA (for CFG generation):
```
cd $OSCFI_PATH/svf-src

export LLVM_SRC="$OSCFI_PATH/llvm-src"

mkdir debug-build
cd debug-build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ../

```

## Spec Benchmark Build Guideline [deprecated: update soon]
1. Put spec2006-oscfi.cfg file into folder $CPU2006_HOME/config and analyze CPU2006 to generate bc files
```text
cd $CPU2006_HOME
. ./shrc
rm -rf benchspec/CPU2006/*/exe/
runspec  --action=run --config=spec2006-oscfi.cfg --tune=base --size=test --iterations=1 --noreportable all
```
2. Change the Makefile.spec in the build directory of the benchmark (e.g. ~/spec/benchspec/CPU2006/456.hmmer/build/build_base_amd64-m64-softbound-nn.0000/Makefile.spec):
```text
# add oscfi.c, mpxrt.c, mpxrt-utils.c in the source list, keep others same
SOURCES=oscfi.c mpxrt.c mpxrt-utils.c ...
```
3. Use the run.sh to start the system.

## Sample Tests
- Vulnerable code exploitation prevented by OS-CFI:
```
cd testSuite
./test_run.sh
```

- For CPU2006spec 456.hmmer benchmark:
```
./test_hmmer.sh < inHmmer
```
